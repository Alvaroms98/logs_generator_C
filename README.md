# Logs generator for a factory

It's just a little project to refresh C language I/O functions.

To build the binary, run (inside the repo directory):

```bash
make main
```

and, to clean binaries and objects, run:
```bash
make clean
```

The program will ask you for your "Employee ID" (4 digits) and it will 
generate a log file named with the current date. Then it will prompt a console menu interface where you will be able to add, watch and delete logs.
